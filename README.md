# Pedestrian-Driver-Interaction
This project aims to look at the crossing behaviour of Indian pedestrians and their interactions with the drivers (if any). This study is the foundational step to create a better interface between the future smart vehicles and the pedestrians  while keeping in mind the Pedestrian-Driver joint attention in Indian traffic environments
